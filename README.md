# ACGAutomation
AutoClickerGameAutomation is a Python script utilizing PyAutoGUI and keyboard libraries to automate in-game actions by assigning specific keys to trigger triple-clicks at predefined coordinates.<br>
I used it so it could select a specific character in OW faster. I don't recommend you use it in this game or any other game that requires an online connection and could potentially ban users for using any third-party software <br>
Use config.jason to assign buttons to coordinates. 
Here are the steps to deploy this project:
<pre>
1. Install Python
  a. install libraries - pip install keyboard
  b. install libraries - pip install pyautogui keyboard
2. In your terminal - python main.py
3. Try any assigned button in config.jason
</pre>
